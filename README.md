# KLay with a C

C++ implementation of [KLay](https://github.com/pedrozudo/klay).

KLay makes circuits go brrr on the gpu.

## Usage

Install the Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run some tests:
```bash
python main.py
```

I only tested with Python 3.12 on ARM Mac, but other platforms should work as well.
